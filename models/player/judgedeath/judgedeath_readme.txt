Accessory's description	: Judge Death, out ot punish the crime of
			  life in Half-Life arenas everywhere.
			  This would be my 3rd model, and to date,
			  my best. He would probably benefit from
			  a little weight loss (865 triangles and
			  2 256x256 textures), but he'll do for now.

Additional Credits to   : valve, chumbalum soft

You know who Half-Life belongs to. Judge Death is the property of Fleetway Publications, Ltd. The model is mine, all mine. But not the animations.

Feel free to tinker with him, but abuse me, and I'll send a frustrated convict over to teach you why abuse hurts from the inside. M'kay?
