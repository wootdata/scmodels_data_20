This is the SnakeEyes model of G.I. Joe fame. Any of you whom may remember him, remember him as the biggest badass. Well, all you need to do is place this in your X:\Sierra\Half-Life\Valve\Models\Player\Snake directory. From there, run Half-Life and  select the new model. *Remember this is just the first version so far. I am working on a better one which uses the chrome texture (best described as the skin the female asassins use in the single player version of the game). Until then, enjoy it.
