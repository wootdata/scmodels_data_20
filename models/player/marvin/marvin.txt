Model description       : It's Marvin the Martian

Other info              : Flamingice made the Marvin model, all the Marvin skins, and the skin mapping for his models.  I (Fafner) did the animations, the sounds, exported/compiled everything, added the Action vwep, and made the dynamite model and skin.  The Action Q2 weapons are by the Action team.

                          Kodiak (that's me) converted it for use in Half-Life

Do whatever you want with this as long as you aren't making money.  You can't use this as a base for other models and don't try to convert this for use in another game without the ok from the people here!  If you wanna use Marvin in a movie or a mod or whatever go ahead as long as we get credit for it.
