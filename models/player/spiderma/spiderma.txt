Spiderman Skin/Model

This is Spiderman using my Blade model which in turn is based on Superman by Austin.

I downloaded a Spiderman skin from the internet and really didn't
think much of it, so I made my own.



Place Spiderman.mdl and Spiderman.bmp in a new folder called Spiderman in SIERRA\Half-life\valve\models\player folder.

Other skins by Me:
Blade
Batman
Predator
Quake_Blade
